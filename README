How long have you been wanting to learn new technical skills? Maybe you want 
to find a better job in a new field, or to advance in your current career into 
a more technical and higher paying position - or maybe you're working on an 
electronics or sensor data project that requires some more coding know-how? 
Have you been frustrated by online classes, been taken in by the promise of 
easy learning on your own time, but came away from the lessons with no real 
understanding and even more confusion?

Come to a hands-on, intensive, one day workshop and learn in a small group 
setting where you will get personal attention from an instructor who will 
answer every question you have about computers, data, web applications, and 
programming, and will help you every step of the way.

The "Thinking Like A Programmer" workshops are regularly held online and in
real world locations. Scholarships at low or no cost are available for 
underrepresented students who have no means to pay. See workshop locations, 
schedules, and times here:

You can also find more information about teaching the workshops in a blog post
